## Day 1

### Goals

To see how well you understand loops, conditions and arrays in Javascript.

### Summary

Build a sequential background color changing gradient website.

### Deadline

Saturday 3rd of December 2022, 6pm W.A.T.

### Instructions
- Create a Github repository containing a suitable name for your task.
- Clone the empty repository to your local machine
- In the folder created on cloning the repository, create a one page website that changes its background gradient sequentially on clicking on the previous and next button. This means on clicking the next button, the background gradient should change to the next gradient in the default colors list; the reverse should happen on clicking the previous button.
- The initial background gradient on viewing the page for the first time must be (#780206 and #061161).
- A default list of background colors must be used. (Its referenced below)
- Once the default colors are exhausted, the background should again change to the first gradient on the list.
- Once the page is completed, push your changes to Github.
- Deploy it on Github pages.

### Default Gradient List
- #FBD3E9, #BB377D
- #00d2ff, #3a7bd5

- #232526, #414345
- #5C258D, #4389A2
- #4776E6, #8E54E9

### Technical requirements
- Make use of Javascript ES6
- The name of the Github repository must be one suitable with your project.
- The webpage must be a single page
- Use fontawesome direction icons for the previous and next button
- The previous button must be located at the far left of the page while the next button must be located at the far right hand side of the page.

### Nice to have (bonus points)
- It would be nice to use a frontend framework of choice. e.g Reactjs, Vuejs etc
- A readme.md file containing information about the project and how to run it locally
- A social media post on twitter or LinkedIn about your Day1 task using the hashtag #Cdv20DaysOfCode
