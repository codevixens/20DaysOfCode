## Day Four

### Goals
To see how well you can make use of HTML form elements.

### Summary
Create a movie ticket booking form for a cinema website.

### Tip
Check similar movie ticket booking websites for inspiration on what the form should contain.

### Deadline
On or before Thursday 8th of December 2022, 9pm W.A.T.

### Instructions
- Create a new Github repository.
- Make sure to factor in a good repository name, one that explains what you are building.
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- In the folder created on cloning the repository, build a static webpage for a cinema house.
- The static webpage should contain a form that lists out all information needed to book a movie ticket on a website.
- Once the page is completed, push your changes to Github.
- Deploy it on Github pages.

### Technical requirements
- The name of the Github repository must be suitable with your project.
- The form must contain input fields that a movie ticket booking website should contain.
- The webpage must be responsive.

### Nice to have (bonus points)
- It would be nice to use a css framework of choice. e.g Bootstrap, Tailwindcss etc.
- It would be a bonus if you create a post on either twitter or LinkedIn about your day 4 task using the hashtag #Cdv20DaysOfCode.

### Submitting Your Code
- Link to the Github repository.
- The generated link by Github pages in the Codevixens Academy slack channel for 20DaysOfCode #Day4.
- Link to the social media post you made.. if any.
